# Exercise: Deep Neural Network and Backpropagation
Hi! This is our repository for second homework of advance machine learning course.

Our Group: 
* Avitabile Luca
* Broglio Matteto
* Colombi Marco 
* Loretucci Lorenzo

Repository Structure:  
- Open _Exercise_NN_Backprop.pdf_ for reading what to do.
- On _two_layernet.py_ there are all our solution to solve question 1-3. 
- Run _ex2_FCnet.py_ to show our resoults.
- On _Notebook_For_HW2.ipynb_ there are our experiment and process to understand how mathematically the network works. 
- On _ex2_pytorch.py_ there is our solution for question 4.
- Run _ex2_pytorch_final_plot.py_ to train the NN and show some plot. 
- See also the _report.pdf_ for our final conclusion.
